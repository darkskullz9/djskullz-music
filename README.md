# My really first website project
Hi, it's Steven AKA @darkskullz9 and there's my really first website project.

This project's an old I started in my first year in high-school, just to share my music (beats and mixes).
Today I've found it in my cloud storage and think it's could be a good idea to finish this one with what I learned.

So I'm gonna share it with you and like that you maybe could help me or just observe the progression of the project. 😁
